### Hey brothers 😁!! 

- 💚 Nationality: _Brazil_;
- ⚒️ I am training on: _Python_;
- 🧏‍♂️ Pronouns: _he/him_;
- 🔮 Programs i'm using: Google Colab;
- 📖 Facts about me:

I'm usually more focused on my school studies, but when it's possible, 
I try to create something with Python, as it's a very simple and good language.

I'm a JUNIOR programmer, which means I'm still starting out in programming,
 which is why some projects are simple lol
